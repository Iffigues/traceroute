Traceroute is a commonly used network diagnostic tool that allows you to trace the route that packets take from your computer to a destination host. The tool works by sending packets with increasing time-to-live (TTL) values and recording the IP addresses of the routers that respond with ICMP "time exceeded" messages.

To recode traceroute, you can start by writing a program that sends packets with increasing TTL values and records the IP addresses of the routers that respond. Here's a general outline of the steps involved:

Set a variable for the maximum number of hops (TTL values) to try.
For each TTL value from 1 to the maximum number of hops:
a. Send a packet to the destination with the TTL value set to the current TTL.
b. Record the IP address of the router that responds with an ICMP "time exceeded" message.
c. If the destination is reached (i.e., a packet is received with an ICMP "echo reply" message), stop the traceroute.
Print out the list of recorded IP addresses in the order they were received.
